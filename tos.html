    <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
        <p>For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below, unless the context otherwise requires:</p>

            <li><strong>“Intellectual Property Rights”</strong> refer to all copyrights, trademarks, moral rights, database rights, design rights, patents, and any other intellectual property rights worldwide in the Media.</li>
            <li><strong>“Deposit”</strong> refers to a refundable monetary sum paid in advance by the Client, calculated based upon the geographical distance from the designated location (to be specified by MPhotography), which serves as a security to cover travel and operational costs associated with Services rendered beyond a threshold radius.</li>
            <li><strong>“Designated Location”</strong> means the fixed geographic point or address from which distance calculations for Deposit purposes are derived, as specified by MPhotography.</li>

        <p>By engaging MPhotography’s Services and executing the accompanying Media Release, the Client may choose to grant MPhotography, its agents, representatives, licensees, successors, and assigns, the unrestricted, irrevocable right and license to capture, reproduce, edit, publish, display, distribute, sublicense, and otherwise use the Media for Advertising and promotional purposes worldwide in perpetuity, without limitation or further compensation.</p>
        <p>The Client acknowledges and agrees that:</p>

    <h2>4. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which MPhotography operates, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located therein.</p>

    <h2>5. Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>This Agreement, including the Consent and Media Release documents, constitutes the entire understanding between the Client and MPhotography with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, representations, or understandings, whether written or oral.</p>

    <h2>6. Deposit and Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>In consideration of the travel and operational expenditures incurred by MPhotography for Services rendered beyond the Distance Threshold from the Designated Location, a Deposit shall be levied according to the following parameters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The initial 30 kilometers radius from the location defined by [Leslie & Elgin Mills East (defined by the coordinates <b>(43.898552457697996, -79.39582126954045)</b>)] shall be exempt from any Deposit charges.</li>
            <li>For all distances exceeding the Distance Threshold, a base Deposit fee of <strong>CAD $10</strong> shall be applied.</li>
            <li>In addition to the base fee, a Distance-Based Fee of <strong>CAD $1</strong> per every incremental two (2) kilometers rounded up to nearest integer beyond the initial 30 kilometers shall be charged.</li>
            <li>The Deposit shall be collected in advance of the Services and shall be <strong>fully refundable</strong> to the Client following the successful completion of the event or Services, subject to any deductions only for extraordinary expenses reasonably incurred.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Client acknowledges and agrees that the Deposit is a prerequisite to booking confirmation and that failure to remit the Deposit may result in cancellation or rescheduling of the Services.</p>
